	<p class="title">ICED SWEET TEA<br><br><span class="info">I’m not a fan of carbonated drinks so this tea is like my alternative to soda. Again it’s a tea with a lot of sugar. Nothing better than being caffinated on a sugar high. I just like the taste of black tea and in this case, iced with a lot of sugar. I’d say the least expensive the better, unless fancy sweet tea is your thing. I’d say <a class="pureleaf" href="https://www.pureleaf.com/us/products/iced-sweet-tea#:~:text=A%20classic%20deserves%20respect%2C%20so,a%20delicious%20fresh%2Dbrewed%20taste.&text=Starting%20from%20freshly%20picked%20leaves,a%20delicious%20fresh%2Dbrewed%20taste.">Pure Leaf</a> is my favorite bottled version of this drink, but it’s a drink that you can easily make at home without messing up too badly. Also I'm a no-lemon-in-iced-tea kind of person.</span></p>
